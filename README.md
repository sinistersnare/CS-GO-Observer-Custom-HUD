# CS:GO Observer Custom HUD

Shout-out to [RedSparr0w](https://github.com/RedSparr0w) for base code and idea! You are the best, man.

## Instructions for running

- Make sure Node.Js and NW.js binaries are added to PATH.
- Add the CFG's from `files/cfg` to CSGO's `cfg` folder.
- Join server to observe
- In this folder, run `$ nw .` to run the UI Selector
- Select Sin HUD for best UI
- run `exec observer.cfg` in console.
- please report any missing features or bugs!

This HUD can be run when observing a game. For example, when watching a demo or a match thru GOTV.


## Main methods
It's worth noting all methods return JSONs or `false` boolean, so be prepared for that.

All of main action that will take place on your screen happens in `updatePage()` function, so when you want to represent some information you will need to write your code within its boundaries.

```javascript
function updatePage(data) {
	// Here happens magic
}
```

`data` variable is being passed to it, and from that we can take actions, such as getting informations about players, map, round phases, etc. Below you will find detailed information about received information :>

### `data`

Methods to obtain different objects:


|Method|Description|Example|Returned objects|
|---|---|---|---|
|`getPlayers()`|List of players|`var players = data.getPlayers();`|(Array of Players)|
|`getCT()`|CT's informations|`var ct = data.getCT();`|(Team)|
|`getT()`|T's informations|```var t = data.getT();```|(Team)|
|`getObserved()`|Currently spectated player|```var player = data.getObserved();```|(Player) If you are not spectating anyone, returned Player will have Steam ID 1 and name GOTV|
|`getPlayer(int observer_slot)`|Player with given observation slot (o-9)|```var first = data.getPlayer(1);```|(Player)|
|`phase()`|Game's current phase|```var phase = data.phase();```|(Phase)|
|`round()`|Round's information|```var round = data.round();```|(Round)|
|`map()`|Map's information|```var map = data.map();```|(Map)|
|`previously()`|If anything changed since last update, it will contain the previous value|```var previously = data.previously();```|(Array) More information about `previously()` you will find on the bottom|


Example:

```javascript
function updatePage(data) {
	var player = data.getObserved(); //Getting spectated players object
    var team_ct = data.getCT(); //CT's informations
    var team_t = data.getT(); //T's informations

    var round = data.round();

    $("#team_ct_name").html(team_ct.name); //Setting ct's name
    $("#team_ct_score").html(team_ct.score); //Setting t's name

    var playerlist = data.getPlayers(); // Array of player objects
    for(var steamid in playerlist){
    	/* Actions here will be taken for each player */
        var cur_player = playerlist[steamid];

        var cur_name = cur_player.name;
        var cur_stats = cur_player.getStats();
    }


}
```
